Introduction text : 

“This isn’t just another website that simply informs you about the ongoing issue of educational inequality. This platform exists to prove that one voice, one that might seem small, insignificant, unheard, can, in fact, create an impact.
My team and I are dedicated to ensuring that people, regardless of their socioeconomic status, nationality, or age, are aware of the pressing issue of educational inequality, an issue that, by now, should have been long resolved.
When you meet someone for the first time, one of the most common questions is: Where do you come from? For me, this has never been an easy question to answer. My mother is from Ukraine, raised in a small village near the Russian border in Sumskaya Oblast, Ulyanovka. My father was born and raised in Eastern Germany. My brother and I were born in Vienna, attended the American International School, and today, I live in Andover, Massachusetts, while my brother resides in Shanghai, China.
I am a three-year junior at Phillips Academy Andover, but my interest in educational inequity began at a very young age.
My parents chased every single opportunity that came their way. They lived by the belief that "opportunities only knock once, but if opportunity doesn’t knock, build a door." They have given me everything, and I will forever be grateful for the opportunities I have been afforded. Yet, while giving me everything they possibly could, they also made sure I never forgot my privilege. They taught me never to take anything for granted and that just because I have access to opportunities that others must fight tirelessly for, I should not become complacent. Instead, it should drive me to work even harder to create meaningful change in a world that so desperately needs it.
This platform is not just about spreading awareness; it is about action. It is about showing students like myself that if you put your mind, energy, and soul into something, you can achieve greatness. Hard work and determination are your fuel, and knowledge is your privilege, but it is up to you how you choose to use that privilege.
Privilege is often perceived negatively, but at its core, it simply means an advantage, whether by birth, social position, effort, or circumstance. However, in my eyes the negative connotation of privilege, comes with privilege in ceratin necessityties. The privilege of access to education, a quality education that can open doors and shape futures, should not be a privilege at all; it should be a right infact its a necessity for each and every person on this planet. 
It is 2025. We can fly to the moon, we can access limitless information with a single click, we can travel and explore new frontiers. Yet, over 80% of children in low-income countries cannot read and understand a simple text by age 10, trapping them in a cycle of poverty and stripping them of the chance at higher education. As a result, 62% of the world’s eligible population is unable to access college, reinforcing global inequality and economic disparity.
This must change. And change starts with us.
My name is Anastasia Leandra Paul and my mission is to spotlight educational inequality and inspire conversations and actions to bridge the worldwide opportunity gap for students. Through thought-provoking podcasts, curated articles, and a growing community of passionate individuals, we aim to empower teenagers to become agents of change. Together, we can raise awareness, spark dialogue, and explore impactful ways to make education equitable for all.“

Projects & Initiatives

“Academic Year 2022–2023 Peer Tutoring in German and Russian
During my first year at Phillips Academy Andover in 9th grade, I began working as a peer tutor in German and Russian. Drawing on my native-level proficiency in both languages, I supported students who needed extra help with grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, and cultural context. Through the community, I also contributed subtitles in German and Russian, helping to make educational content more accessible to a broader audience. This experience strengthened my belief that language is a powerful tool for inclusion and empowerment.”

“May to September 2024: English Tutoring for Ukrainian Students
From May to September 2024, I dedicated a total of 25 hours to tutoring English for Ukrainian students who had recently arrived in Austria. My goal was to support their integration into a new school system by helping them improve their language skills in a safe and encouraging environment. These sessions allowed me to build meaningful connections and witness the power of education in fostering confidence and resilience. This experience deepened my understanding of how direct, personal support can contribute to greater educational equity.

“June – July 2024: Student Exchange in Montenegro
In the summer of 2024, I organized a two-week educational exchange program for 10 fellow Students from Phillips Academy Andover, in Montenegro. We were collaborating with the non-governmental organization “Nasa Akcia”, based in Kotor. I organized and engaged in in-depth discussions and workshops with students and teachers from Tivat and Kotor. Our goal was to better understand the differences and common challenges in the Montenegrin and U.S. educational systems. This experience gave me valuable insight into how educational inequality manifests across countries—and how collaboration and open dialogue can spark innovative solutions.”

Planned for June 2025 Charity Event at the Vienna Children’s Reading Festival
“As part of my ongoing commitment to educational equity, I will be organizing a charity event during the Vienna Children’s Reading Festival (Wiener Kinderlesefest), an initiative by the City of Vienna and Wiener Städtische Versicherung that promotes literacy among young people. I’ll be raising funds by selling snacks and drinks at the festival, and all proceeds will go directly to Teach For Austria. This event not only supports an organization I deeply believe in, but also aligns perfectly with the mission of empowering children through access to quality education and the joy of reading.”

Planned for July – August 2025 Internship Teach for Austria
“In summer 2025, I will complete a three-week internship with Teach For Austria, a non-profit organization dedicated to reducing educational inequality by placing highly motivated university graduates in underprivileged schools and kindergartens. Teach For Austria believes that every child—regardless of their background—deserves access to quality education and inspiring teachers. As an intern, I will gain firsthand experience with the challenges and innovations of the Austrian school system, contribute to ongoing projects, and support the mission of creating equitable learning environments.”
